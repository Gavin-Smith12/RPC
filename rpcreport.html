        QUESTION
  - -  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->
<div class="qa">

<ol class="qa">
<li class="q">Did you implement an rpcgenerate program and does it handle all legal IDL files? If not, which test cases should we try in your submission  directory?</li>
<li class="a">
We did implement an rpcgenerate program and it should handle all legal IDL files.
</li>

<li class="q">What programming language did you use for your rpcgenerate program?</li>
<li class="a">
Put an X in the space next to your choice:
<ul>
  <li>_____ C++ (using the provided type framework)</li>
  <li> X Python (using the provided <code>idl_to_json</code>)</li>
  <li>_____ Ruby (using the provided <code>idl_to_json</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li class="q">Briefly explain the protocol you use over TCP to request function calls and return the results.</li>
<li class="a">
The protocol we use over TCP to request function calls is that we read all of 
the individual arguments from the function call into strings and write them over
TCP individually as well. This means that for things like arrays or structs, each 
of the sub-elements are also written seperately. For example, if there is an
array of ten ints, they will all be put into their own strings and will all 
have their own write calls over the network. Also, each argument is just 
converted to a string, which can make getting the information a bit more bloated,
but it ensures that everything is in the same format on both ends of the network.
Then, the stub reads the arguments
by reading from the buffer, and since each of the arguments were sent seperately,
they are all null terminated, so when reading from the buffer we do not have 
to know the lengths of anything. After each read the argument is put into
the data structure it originally belonged to (since it was sent as a string) 
and we increment an integer that tells us how much of the buffer has already 
been read (and we can get this value from then afterwards getting the length
of the string that was read). The function is then called and the return value
is sent back in a similar fashion to how it was sent by the proxy initally, 
and then the proxy reads the message sent over TCP the same way that the stub
did. 
</li>

<li class="q">Did you get help from anyone other than your teammate? If "yes", then briefly explain who helped you and how.</li>
<li class="a">
No we did not receive help from anybody else.
</li>


<li class="q">(optional) Do you have any other comments on this assignment (e.g. was it worthwhile, what did you learn from it, do you have suggestions for improvment if the course is offered again)?</li>
<li class="a">
We thought that this assignment had similar strengths to the last one. First,
having the assignment cover such a large scope required a large amount of planning
beforehand, and even then there were many issues that arose while actually 
doing the coding. This experience helps to increase our skills of planning large
systems and dealing with issues when they arise during the project. Second, this
project was good because it gave us some programming experience in a more commonly
used language like python. The Tufts curriculum is very heavy in C and C++ so it
is a nice repreive to be able to use something else, especially a language as 
commonly used as python. Third, this assignment heavily rewards modularity. 
We have found that in retrospect for both assignments that there were many
opportunities to make our programs more modular, which would have increased
readability and probably efficiency. Although it is hard to go back and refactor
all of our code now, it does help to make sure that in the future we take more 
stock in thinking about how we can make our code more modular.

<h2 id="reportbody">ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</h2>

<p>This will be just a brief overview of how we parsed through the arguments
in the python as this is the bulk of the code that we wrote. For the cases
of strings, ints, and floats the way that we parsed them is similarly 
simple. When sending these arguments from the proxy to the stub we just 
loop through the arguments and see what the types are, and for these types
listed above we just convert them to strings and send them over. Then in the 
stub we again loop through the arguments and do the same thing but opposite.
This process gets much more complicated when we parse through arbitrarily deep
arrays and structs. The process for parsing both of these is similar. If 
an argument has a type of array it is looped through, and one has to look at 
the type of the array indecies to see what to do next. If the array is of a simple
type you can just read each index as the desired type, but if it is a struct or
an array you have to look again at the JSON data. In the JSON data you then
have to take the array type and look at our "typeDict" which is a list of 
all of the types from the IDL. From this you just look at the type again and 
repeat the same process. The only difference with structs is that each type
is not the same, so for each loop you have to see what the new type is. In theory
this code does not sound complicated but a lot of our python code is a bit jumbled,
this is due to not accounting for modularity beforehand. Each of the functions
where we loop through an array or struct to get all of its members could be 
consolidated, but we did not think of this until it was too late.</p>

<p>The design choice that we made to have all of the writes to the server be
seperate writes made it so that our code was easy to write and debug, but 
it came at the cost of performace. Because we wrote all writes to be seperate
we had to add things like sleeps in our code so that the client/server has 
enough time to do all the reads before the writing is done. I think this tradeoff
was a good choice because the hit to our overall performance was not that great
and it made it so that our python and C++ code is much easier to read and interpret.
